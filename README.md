Hey there! My name is Gabriel, and I'm from Perú.👋

Currently, I'm studying a Technical Career about Computer Science, and also feeding my knowledge through Self-Learning Resources.👀

I like learning new things, specially if Computer-Related.🖥️

Oh, and I looking forward to make a blog to share each day of this adventure, and document all my progress and the projects that I'm gonna do in my free time!✨
